# Water-Quality-Classification
Water Quality Classification
🚀 A Machine Learning Project to Predict Water Potability

📖 Overview
Why is this project important?

Clean drinking water is essential for public health. This project uses machine learning models to classify water samples as potable (safe) or non-potable (unsafe) based on key chemical properties.

What does this project do?

Analyzes water quality data.

Builds predictive models to classify potability.

Identifies important factors affecting water safety.


📂 Dataset
Dataset Used:
Kaggle Dataset: Water Quality Dataset

Number of Samples: X rows, Y features

Target Variable: Potability
0 → Not Potable (Unsafe for drinking)
1 → Potable (Safe for drinking)


Features Explained:

pH-Acidity or alkalinity of water. Safe range: 6.5–8.5

Hardness-Mineral content affecting taste & plumbing

Solids-Total dissolved solids (TDS) in water

Chloramines-Disinfectants used in water treatment

Conductivity-Water’s ability to conduct electricity

Organic Carbon-Organic compounds in water

Trihalomethanes	-Byproducts of chlorination

Turbidity	-Cloudiness due to suspended particles

📌 Key Challenges:


🔹 Missing Data → Some samples have missing values.

🔹 Unbalanced Classes → More unsafe water samples than safe ones.

🔹 Feature Correlation → Some features may be interdependent.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages & Libraries:

🔹 Python – Core programming language.

🔹 pandas, numpy – Data processing.

🔹 matplotlib, seaborn, plotly – Visualization.

🔹 scikit-learn – Machine Learning models.

Tools Used:

✅ Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook – For development.


📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Why is EDA Important?

Before applying machine learning, we analyze the data to find patterns, missing values, and relationships between variables.

📌 Key EDA Steps:

✔️ Handling missing values → Used mean/median imputation for missing data.

✔️ Feature Correlation Analysis → Used heatmaps to detect relationships between variables.

✔️ Distribution of Features → Used histograms, KDE plots, and box plots.

✔️ Class Imbalance Check → More non-potable water samples than potable.

📈 Visual Insights:


pH Levels: Most samples lie between 6.5-8.5, but some extreme values exist.

Conductivity vs. Potability: High conductivity often indicates non-potable water.

Turbidity: Higher turbidity values are often linked with unsafe drinking water.

🤖 Model Training & Evaluation

📌 Goal: Train machine learning models to predict water potability based on features.

🔹 Preprocessing Steps:

Scaled numerical features (MinMaxScaler).

Handled missing values.

Encoded categorical variables (if any).

🔹 ML Models Used:

✅ Logistic Regression – Simple baseline model.

✅ Decision Tree – Interpretable but prone to overfitting.

✅ Random Forest – Robust and accurate.

✅ XGBoost – Powerful model for classification.

📊 Evaluation Metrics:

Metric	Definition

Accuracy	Overall correctness of the model.

Precision	Ability to avoid false positives.

Recall	Ability to detect all true positives.

F1-score	Balance between Precision & Recall.

🚀 Best Model: Random Forest with X% Accuracy

📈 Results & Insights

Most Important Features for Prediction:

🔹 pH Level – Extreme values indicate unsafe water.

🔹 Chloramines – High concentrations affect potability.

🔹 Conductivity – Strongly correlated with potability.

Findings:

📌 Water with very high/low pH levels is likely unsafe.

📌 Higher conductivity often means non-potable water.

📌 Chloramines & turbidity affect potability significantly.
